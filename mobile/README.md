# Time Tracker Mobile Widget

A simple React Native widget built with Expo to control the Time Tracker server.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

The widget expects the API server running on `http://localhost:5000`. Adjust the `SERVER_URL` constant in `App.js` if needed.
